# MultiPersist
Inspired by the Multiplicative Persistence Challenge, the program takes in a number and calculates the multiplicative persistence of that number. The world record multiplicative persistence for the smallest number discovered so far is 11.

Uses a Recursive method to calculate a new number from the previously multiplied digits.
